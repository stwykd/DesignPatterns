# ABSTRACT FACTORY #

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Use the Abstract Factory pattern when
 - a system should be independent of how its products are created,composed, and represented.
 - a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
 - a family of related product objects is designed to be used to get her,and you need to enforce this constraint.
 - you want to provide a class library of products,and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations.
